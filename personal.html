    <p>â€‹My name is <strong>Ahmad Khuzaimi Bin Abdul Wahid</strong>. I was born on the 5 September in 1998, which means I am 20 years old now. I have got 3 siblings; I have 3 elder sister, 1  brother.Then I have got my mom and dad too. My dad name is <u>Abdul Wahid Bin Mat Hassan</u> and he was 57 years old. My mom name is <u>Mek Soom Binti Jusoh</u> and right now my mom already 53years old  I'm mostly close with my sister, as she's the only sister that always help when i have some problem like i don't know to solve the question or anything else. 
    <P>I am a pretty responsible person and I do what I am supposed to do. As now, I am a student in school, therefore I do my homework every single day and study for what I have learned at home. I also pay attention in class most of the time as well. Besides that, I organize my work as well. At home, I am a child, so I respect my parents and help them to do house works, such as doing laundries and washing dishes. I clean my room once a week as well because that is my responsibility as being a child. I also help out friends and classmates when they need help. I give out advices and suggestions to them when they need support and help as well. Generally, I can say that I am a responsible person who does my duties.</p>
