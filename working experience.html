	<p>Work experience is any experience that a person gains while working in a specific field or occupation, but the expression is widely used to mean a type of volunteer work that is commonly intended for young people often students to get a feel for professional working environments.For example,while waiting for the result of STPM come out, I worked in one of the hypermarkets in Kota Bharu. I was assigned a cashier postion.I worked there for 8 months. While working there, I learned a lot of new knowledge that I have never learned before. This is my first experience working in the private sector. i learned to be responsible for accepting payments from customers and giving change and receipts. Also, I was trained to resolve customer disputes in a calm and intelligent manner. Next, I also ensure proper management of daily cash accounts.</p>
